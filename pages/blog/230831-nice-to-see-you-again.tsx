                    <p className="pb-3">It is with great excitement that we announce our return! We are thrilled to be back and ready to share a little bit of us with you again. We have been diligently working to create engaging content that is both informative and entertaining, and we look forward to connecting with you again.</p>

                    {/* heading */}
                    <h3 className="text-3xl py-5 font-bold">Family of Four</h3>

                    {/* content */}
                    <p className="pb-3">Close to a year ago, our family welcomed our newest addition, Selena Maeve. With a new baby comes a lot of changes and adjustments, but it's all worth it. It was a year of firsts for Selena and for our family. Sofia has been the best big sister by caring for Selena the best way she can. She has been a huge help by wanting to play and watch over her sister. There’s no feeling that melts our hearts more than when you see their faces light up every morning when they see each other when they wake up.</p>
                    <p className="pb-3">We took our first big family trip in May. It was to Denver for a work trip, but decided to make a mini family vacation out of it. It was the girls' first airplane ride. Sofia wasn't as excited as we thought she would be. She just took her seat and just asked when we were going to get there and took a nap. Selena took us by surprise and stayed up the entire trip looking around and making friends on the plane with smiles and giggles.</p>
                    <p className="pb-3">Our first family roadtrip was to San Diego. We didn't get to dip our toes in any water, but we had just as much fun visiting friends and enjoying the California weather. We did take another roadtrip to Lake Arrowhead for Sofia's fourth birthday and found this amusement park, SkyPark, which was pretty awesome. It had lots of outdoor things for Sofia to enjoy like rock climbing, mini-tractor driving, and treehouses. We plan on going back when Selena is a little older. It was such a great family getaway!</p>
                    {/* heading */}
                    <h3 className="text-3xl py-5 font-bold">Selena</h3>

                    {/* content */}
                    <p className="pb-3">Selena has learned to crawl, walk, eat, babble, and play. Her personality is as goofy as her sister and just as happy. She currently loves Ms. Rachel and we don’t know why but her favorite thing to play with is a toy broom and a hairbrush. It makes us laugh each time when she goes straight for it during playtime.</p>
                    <p className="pb-3">Selena is learning to sleep through the night, but it is getting a little difficult because she loves to cuddle. The cutest thing is when we’re on the couch and she crawls over to just lay her head on my chest. She’ll give a kiss if you ask her, but her cute open mouth kisses are getting dangerous because she has four teeth (two top and two bottom) all in the front. Selena definitely uses her teeth to her advantage and can chase down anyone with a snack.</p>
                    <p className="pb-3">She’s getting so good at walking that she tries to chase her sister when Sofia runs around. It’s just so cute. Selena will try to yell to get Sofia to slow down cause her little legs just aren’t fast enough.</p>

                    {/* heading */}
                    <h3 className="text-3xl py-5 font-bold">Sofia</h3>

                    {/* content */}
                    <p className="pb-3">This firecracker has been taking karate and she’s getting very good at it. She listens and picks up very well. We’re just working on her shyness and nervousness around people she doesn’t know. It’s overwhelming for her, but she’s trying her best and we tell her that’s all that matters. We tell her that as long as she shows up and takes one step at a time, she’ll be fine. Her karate teacher has been very patient and celebrates the wins with us. </p>
                    <p className="pb-3">Each week Sofia has been spending time with her grandparents exploring different playgrounds and learning new things. She’s always so excited to come home and tell us all about the adventures of the day and everything she’s learned. She’s getting so good at drawing and writing her name. She loves to color and do arts and crafts.</p>
                    <p className="pb-3">Sofia loves to sing and dance--always putting on a performance for us. She’s really into Disney musicals like Descendants, Zombies, and Camp Rock. And even listens to the soundtracks in the shower alternating with Black Pink. She’s watches intently and follows along with the dances. Sofia is a very energetic girl and her attitude is starting to show. She knows what she wants and she’s very determined to get it. Sofia is so smart that we just have to give her props for her negotiation skills. </p>

                    {/* content */}
                    <p className="pb-3">We sold our first home which was a very stressful and emotional process, but it is also very exciting to be starting a new chapter. Years ago we talked how our sacrifices, time studying, and distress will eventually lead us to bigger things. And now we can look back and say we’re glad we did what we did to get where we’re at. We’re having so much fun making this a dream childhood home for our girls and a good place for them to enjoy for a big chunk of their lives. We definitely have big plans for this home and we’re working our butts off to make it darn near perfect. </p>
                    <p className="pb-3">We’re very blessed that our family supported and helped us along the way and continue to provide us with shelter and help with the girls while we go though this process. We love you with all our hearts and appreciate all that you’re doing for our family. </p>

                    <h3 className="text-3xl py-5 font-bold">What's Next</h3>

                    {/* content */}
                    <p className="pb-3">Selena’s first birthday and baptism is coming up. We’ve been planning this for a couple of months now and we’re very excited to have all our family and friends celebrate with us. Pinterest is killing me with all these cute things I want to do, but I’m trying a simple modest approach this time around. But I don’t know. If you know me, you know I love a good planned party! </p>
                    <p className="pb-3">Sofia has since discovered her videos and has been watching it over and over again—asking when we’ll be making more. That was our sign to get it up and running again. As everything is falling into place and the dust is settling, I can finally get into the rhythm of making content with Sofia again. The fun videos we’re doing are for the memories they can look back on and  we’ll continue until they get tired of it--or my computer crashes and can’t handle us anymore. </p>
                    <p className="pb-3">Oh for the Love of... content is getting a facelift. We’ve worked hard to make it a hub for the Buencamino Family. It’ll be filled with things we’re interested in and things we’ve done. It’ll have a little bit of something for us to read, watch, motivate, and inspire our family and hopefully yours too.</p>
                    <p className="pb-3">We cannot wait to share a little part of us with you again. </p>
